# Merge
This is where I merged the NLP with the Random-Text-Gen 
Credit<br/>
I used Stanford's NLP to phrase structure trees, to extract nouns and verbs. (great school, wish I got in)<br/>
I used Princeton's Word Net 2.1 for a large database of organised words<br/>
I parsed through the JK Rowling's Harry Potter series as my sample text.

Most of the work is in Symplification Class because I hoped that implementing this into symple sentances would end up with near 100% accuracy. Here is what I got:<br/>
Symplification>Symplification>Clause.java<br/>

	The sleet meets.
	A hand and the hand twitch.
